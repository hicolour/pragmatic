### Pragamtic Programmers Notes

Some notes for blog post.

Some sample of pragmatic fp aproach, wihout drama we recently observed in fp communities.

On the end of the day FP-reach languges are just better tools (including libs & avalible toolset) - for a lot problems deveopers solves - but not for all. In many cases, modern imperative languages without like Go are just the right tool.  

Of course decision about the right tool includes multiple technical or none technical factors - finance/economic, human-resource etc.

Key principles:

   * Modularity
   * Testability
   * Performance
   * Maintainbility 
   

Languagess samples:
 * Scala
 * Haskell 
 * ...

The intent is to present various fp 

  * Aproaches Final Tagless, ZIO Environment, Free Monad 
  * Machinery (Cats, Scalz, Cats-effect, ZIO)  
  * Conrete Monads
  * Infrastructure (http4s, akka-http, doobie, slick)

and to use automated metrics collection (where possible to measure footprint) to be able to reason in longer perspective.
