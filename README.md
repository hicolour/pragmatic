# pragmatic-fp
Some sample of pragmatic fp aproach if Scala, wihout a latest community drama, because on the end of the day Scala is just better tool - including  libs & avalible toolset - for daily job.

Key principles:
   * Modularity
   * Testability
   * Performance
   * Maintainbility 
   
The intent is to present various fp 

  * Aproaches Final Tagless, ZIO Environment, Free Monad 
  * Machinery (Cats, Scalz, Cats-effect, ZIO)  
  * Conrete Monads
  * Infrastructure (http4s, akka-http, doobie, slick)

and to use automated metrics collection (where possible to measure footprint) to be able to reason in longer perspective.
